# The Vegan Restaurants Bucketlist for South Korea

My application is designed to help the user track their favourite vegan restaurants in South Korea, and for them to be able to add additional restaurants they might want to try in the future.

Finding vegan restaurants in South Korea can be quite challenging, and this app is meant not only to help the user remember the places they have been to before, but also to store restaurants they plan on trying during their future trips.

The user is able to add and edit both cities and restaurants to the app, and they can also delete restaurants if they wish to. Additionally, they can mark cities as "visited", and restaurants as "tried".
